Here are the compile commands you will use:

lime test windows
lime build windows

But first, you must find out what to install

What To Install:

You must have the most up-to-date version of Haxe, seriously, stop using 4.1.5, it misses some stuff.

open up a Command Prompt/PowerShell or Terminal, type haxelib install hmm

after it finishes, simply type haxelib run hmm install in order to install all the needed libraries for Psych Engine!
